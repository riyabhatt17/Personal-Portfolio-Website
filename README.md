# Personal-Portfolio-Website

Welcome to the README file for my personal portfolio site! This file provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and the technologies used.


## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for potential employers or collaborators to contact me. The website is designed to be fully responsive and visually appealing, with smooth transitions and a clean layout.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## File Structure

The project directory contains the following files and directories:

```
personal-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── womann.png
├── cloud.png
├── riyaportfolio.png
├── amazon clone.png
├── cpp-project.png
└── README.md
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains all the styling for the website.
- `womann.png`: Image used in the home section.
- `cloud.png`: Cloud images used for decoration.

## Customization

You can customize the content and style of the website by editing the HTML and CSS files. Below are some common customizations:

### Changing Text

To change the text content, open the `index.html` file and update the relevant sections. For example, to update the About Me section, find the following code:

```html
<p>
  I'm Riya Bhatt, originally from Haldwani, Uttarakhand, India.
  Currently in my third year of B.Tech in Computer Science, I am
  exploring the realm of web development. This portfolio website
  represents one of my initial projects. As I continue to learn, I'm
  still in the process of acquiring skills and experience. Soon, I'll
  update this section with a comprehensive list of skills and services
  I can offer.
</p>
```

### Updating Images

To update images, replace the existing image files in the project directory with your own images, ensuring they have the same filenames.

### Modifying Styles

To modify the styles, open the `styles.css` file and update the CSS rules. For example, to change the background color of the navbar, find the following code:

```css
.navbar {
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #2cb8b5; /* Navbar background */
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 1000; /* Ensures navbar stays on top */
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

And update the `background-color` property to your desired color.
